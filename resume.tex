\section{Experience}

\subsection{Research}
\cventry{2014--present}{Dissertation Research}{Clemson University}{Clemson, SC}{}{
  Created and implemented algorithms for simulating multiple scattering physics
  in radiative transfer via a novel Monte Carlo technique. Created a high
  throughput computing workflow for distributing the workload across multiple
  computing clusters and thousands of nodes. Currently, conducting parameter
  studies to better understand the multiple scattering technique.
}

\cventry{2013}{Directed Projects}{Clemson University}{Clemson, SC}{}{
  Implemented a plug-in for Blender using the nodes API for volume modeling,
  grid computation, and rendering for an arbitrary volume renderer.  The
  node-based language is sophisticated enough to describe simple fluid
  simulations.
}

\cventry{Summer 2012}{Graduate Research Assistant}
        {The University of Alabama}{Tuscaloosa, AL}{}{
  %Developed and implemented a domain model and visual modeling language for the
  %automatic generation of drivers for robotic devices.
}

        {School of Computing, Clemson University}
        {Clemson, SC}{}{
  Lead developer for Buffet, a web-based automatic version control and database
  provisioning application. It has several collaboration features so users can
  share code and perform code reviews. Also a major contributor to three
  open-source libraries used by Buffet involving version control system
  abstraction and SSH key management. Administrated hundreds of Linux desktops
  and servers used for both classroom and film production purposes.
